# Arma 3 - CTIX

Welcome to the repository for CTIX. CTIX is an addoption of BECTI which is a mission created by Benny in the early ArmA 3 days. With this project we aim for it to update BECTI, improve the project and make it compatible with some mods and maps.

## What is CTI?
CTI (Capture the Island) is a Gamemode that was made by bohemia in ArmA 2 where two sides, West and East fight for the control of an
island. Each side are led by a Commander (Player or AI) which may construct a base thanks to the MHQ (Mobile HQ). As soon as the base is 
available, you may decide to reinforce your team by purchasing additional units and vehicles. Keep in mind that the Commander may assign 
assign different tasks to your team. The mission may be won by destroying the opposite side's base assets (Barracks,Light Vehicle Factory, 
Heavy Vehicle Factory, Aircraft Factory and the MHQ). Money and Supplies are gathered from capturing towns. Expect some resistance of some 
local militia at the towns tho!

## How do I play and install it?
First download the mission trough the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=927466054">STEAMWORKSHOP</a> or trough the Releases page.

Start your Server with the needed mods for the template that you want to run or Start your ArmA 3 (also with the needed mods) go to
